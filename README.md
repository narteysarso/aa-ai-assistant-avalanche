# AI-Enhanced Web3 Access through Natural Language

## Overview
This project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance Web3 access using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. With this tool, users can interact with Web3 applications and protocols using human-like language, simplifying the process of interacting with decentralized systems.

## Features
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can interact with Web3 applications and protocols using everyday language, removing the need for complex commands or technical knowledge.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: This tool makes Web3 more accessible to a wider audience, including individuals who may not have prior experience with blockchain technology.
- **Increased Efficiency**: By utilizing AI for interaction, users can perform tasks more efficiently and intuitively, reducing the barrier to entry for decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols.
- **Customizable**: The system can be adapted to support various Web3 platforms and protocols, making it versatile and scalable.

## Installation
To use this tool, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Add env var
    - make copy of .env.example in ai directory
    - make copy of .env.example in frontend directory
2. Install the required dependencies using 
    - install ai dependencies `cd ai && npm install`
    - install frontend dependencies `cd fronted && npm install`

3. Run the application using
    - run frontend `cd frontend && npm start`
    - run ai server `cd ai && npm run dev`

4. Access the tool through your web browser at the specified localhost address.

## Usage
1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Begin typing or speaking your desired action using natural language.
3. The AI system will process your input and execute the corresponding action on the Web3 platform or protocol.
4. Follow any prompts or instructions provided by the application to complete your desired task.
